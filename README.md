# SItomo
Matlab package for analyzing 2D and 3D distributed anisotropy using finite-frequency shear-wave splitting intensities

For a description of the theory and application examples on synthetic and real data, please refer to the accompanying publication:

Frederik Link & Maureen D. Long, (2024). SItomo â€“ A toolbox for splitting intensity tomography and application in the Eastern Alps,
Journal of Geodynamics, Volume 159, 102018, ISSN 0264-3707, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jog.2024.102018.

Please consider citing this publication if you consider using all or parts of the program for the analysis or newly developed code that result in scientific publications.

A user guide is provided in pdf format and can be found in the "doc" folder.

Please feel free to contact me, if you have questions about details to the program that are not covered sufficiently by the manual or if any problems occur 
while implementing the code in your routines.

Enjoy!
